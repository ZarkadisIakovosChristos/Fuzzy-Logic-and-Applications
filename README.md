# Fuzzy-Logic-and-Applications
This repository contains information and material for the Obesity Levels Classification, a project for the course "Special Topics in Actuarial Theory" (UNIPI, Department of Statistics and Insurance Science). The purpose of the project is to take a deep dive into the Fuzzy Theory, a different approach from the widespread conventional Set Theory and build a strong mathematical and programming background in the fuzzy logic applications, includind fuzzy clustering, fuzzy classification and fuzzy regression. The project was written in Python and R. The first task was to understand fuzzy sets, fussy set operations, construction of fuzzy sets and fuzzy numbers (with emphasis on triangular fuzzy number). The second task was to understand the mathematical background of the Least Fuzziness Principle Regression. The third task was to perform k-means and differentiate the results from the fuzzy c-means and the fuzzy c-means with nosie and evaluate them with fuzzy clustering metrics like, the PartitionCoefficient, the PartitionEntropy, the Modified Partition Coefficient, the Xie and Beni index and the Fuzzy Silhouette Score, with joint hyperparameter tuning for the optimal metric results. The fourth task was about understanding in depth the mathematical background of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Neural Network Classifier and the Deep Shared Linguistic Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Classifier and apply them in network traffic data and the irid dataset respectively.
